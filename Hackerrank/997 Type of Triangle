OUTPUT:

NULL Maria Kristeen Samantha 
NULL Meera NULL NULL 
NULL Naomi NULL NULL 
NULL Priyanka NULL NULL

NOTE: FIRSTLY I had a view, its name Temp. In fact columns name are RowNumber, Doctor, Professor, Singer and Actor. 
THIS IS SIMILAR TO THAT ->    RowNumber Doctor Professor Singer Actor
                              1         Aamina           
                              2         Julia
                              1                          Christeen
                              1                Ashley
                              2                          Jane
                              .
                              .
                              .
                      Then, I do group by RowNumber and I can write Doctor, Professor, Singer and Actor columns of new table,
                        but due to group by I had to a function next of select, I used min function, thus if it does not find any value,
                          it writes NULL.
