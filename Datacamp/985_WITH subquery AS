Using a subquery as a common expression, return all of the columns from the match table 
where win_margin is greater than 20 and the match_winner is equal to 1. Limit the results to 10 rows.



WITH subquery AS (
  SELECT * FROM match WHERE win_margin > 20
)

SELECT 	match_id,
	win_margin
FROM subquery
WHERE match_winner = 1
ORDER BY match_id
LIMIT 10;


OUTPUT:
-------
match_id	win_margin
336019	23
336022	23
419132	39
