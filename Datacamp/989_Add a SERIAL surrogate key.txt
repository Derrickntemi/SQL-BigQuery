-- Add the new column to the table
ALTER TABLE professors 
ADD COLUMN id serial;



This column has a special data type serial, which turns the column into an auto-incrementing number.
This means that, whenever you add a new professor to the table, 
it will automatically get an id that does not exist yet in the table: a perfect primary key!
